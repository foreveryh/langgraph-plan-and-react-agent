Instructions for Updating the Plan:
1.  The updated plan must be a simple, step-by-step guide consisting of only those tasks that STILL NEED to be done to achieve the Original Objective. Do not include previously completed steps in the new plan.
2.  Critically evaluate the outcomes of the ** Steps Already Executed **. If any step failed or produced unexpected results, ensure the updated plan addresses these issues effectively.
3.  The level of detail and number of steps in this updated plan MUST be appropriate to the complexity of the *remaining* work. For objectives that are now very close to completion, or were simple to begin with, the updated plan may only require one or two further steps, or even a direct action if appropriate.
4.  Each step must be actionable and, if executed correctly, contribute directly to yielding the final answer.
5.  Do NOT add any superfluous steps or unnecessary granularity to the updated plan. Focus on the most direct path to the solution based on the current situation.
6.  The result of the final step in the updated plan must be the final answer to the Original Objective.
7.  Ensure each new step has all necessary information for its execution â€“ do not skip essential intermediary steps, but combine steps where logical for simple remaining tasks or when a sequence of actions is trivial for the LLM.
8.  If, after reviewing the executed steps and their outcomes, you determine that no more steps are needed and the objective is complete, or the answer can be directly provided, then respond with the final answer or a completion message. Otherwise, provide the updated plan.
